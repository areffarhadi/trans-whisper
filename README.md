# üó£Ô∏è ASR for Whispered Speech #

Whispered speech is a challenging speaking style for normal ASR models. 

In this repository, we share the fine-tuned version of the OpenAI **`Whisper-large-v2`** model for whispered speech. In this fine-tuning, we used the **WTIMIT** and **CHAINS** datasets.


You can download the [fine-tuned Whisper large v2 model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MB8qjPk8lmtECmuKX0qXhlXr9uwmnA0g/view?usp=sharing) for whispered speech recognition.

Results are reported in these papers:
